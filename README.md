# Object-tracking-with-computer-vision


<h3>this progrrame is a real-time car tracking program that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and track cars in live video streams. This program is designed to accurately identify and follow the movement of cars in real time, providing valuable information for various applications such as traffic monitoring, surveillance, or autonomous driving.</h3>h3>

The key features of my car tracking program include:

### Real-time Car Detection:
The program uses state-of-the-art object detection models, such as YOLO or SSD, to detect cars in each frame of the live video stream. This ensures efficient and            accurate detection of cars in real time.

### Robust Object Tracking: 
Once the cars are detected, a robust object tracking algorithm is employed to track their movement across consecutive video frames. The tracking algorithm utilizes techniques such as optical flow, Kalman filters, or correlation-based methods to estimate and predict the position of the tracked cars.

### Multiple Car Tracking: 
The program can track multiple cars simultaneously, allowing for the monitoring of multiple vehicles within the video stream. Each tracked car is assigned a unique identifier, enabling individual tracking and analysis.

### Real-time Visualization: 
The program provides real-time visualization of the tracked cars, displaying bounding boxes around the detected cars and their trajectories on the video stream. This visual feedback enhances the monitoring and analysis of the car movement.

### Performance Optimization: 
To ensure real-time performance, the program leverages hardware acceleration techniques, such as GPU processing, to speed up the object detection and tracking processes. This enables efficient processing of high-resolution video streams in real time.
